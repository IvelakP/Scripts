# README for YoutubeDownloader

I sometimes need to watch some videos offline when traveling etc. Or want to save some videos for later and be sure they are still available. That's why I came up with idea for this script

## Using

You can find requirements from "requirements.txt", install dependencies and just run the script. Using the tool is easy with informative GUI it has and it even asks for input folder similiarly when downloading and installing applications from internet.
