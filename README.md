# ReadMe for Paavo Mäkelä's "Scripts" Repo

## The idea of this repo is to store small scripts for varoius problems. Every script will have its own ReadMe and technical documentation added later on, and this ReadMe only tells the reader what problem every script is trying to solve and also how I came up with the idea.

### PictureSorting

I had old memory card full of pictures and it would have been pain to go through all of them one by one. So this script opens the images in said folder one-by-one, asks if they should be renamed and saved, skipped or deleted.

### ProductReader

### ReceiptReading

### YoutubeDownloader

I sometimes need to watch some videos offline when traveling etc. Or want to save some videos for later and be sure they are still available. That's why I came up with idea for this script. Simply, like the name indicates, the script downloads the selected Youtube video with highest possible quality.

The script is made just to practice coding and making GUIs and the possibly downloaded videos are going to only private non-commercial use.
