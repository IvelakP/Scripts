# README for picturesorting.py script

The script simply determines the default image viewer for your OS.

Then it uses that image viewer to open image for preview and asks if the image should be skipped, renamed & save or deleted.

## NOTE

The images need to be closed by user. If going through large amount of images this might be inconvenient. I haven't found good solution for this yet.
